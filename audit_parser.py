# This class is used to parse the numbered entries, observations etc..
# It basically extracts out the numbered entries in to an array, separating out headers and observations.
# Its still not generic enough as an interface to be standardized. But works currently

# need to move the whole parsing logic in to this class. eventually should become an interface like:
# ap = AuditParser(finding, finding_detail1,finding_detail2)
# finding_pairs = ap.getRows()
# for (finding,fdetail) in finding_pairs:
#    write_row(finding,fdetail)

    numbered = 1, #numbered - admiss a numbered list
    new_number = 2, #new_numbered - start of a new numbered list
    observation = 3, #observation
    end = 4 #end of text
